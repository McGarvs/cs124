TODO:
* make add-email-input box clear input text after clicking "+" button
* add error checking to prevent duplicate emails to be added
* style "share" button
* indicate email of owner somewhere in the task list view
* indicate to users who don't have permission to update/change lists (as of right now, 
only owners can make changes or add emails) that they don't have permission to do the action.
And prevent the UI from updating when (in the console logs), there are permission errors
since this user doesn't have the permission to do this action.

Optional:
* support editing list names
