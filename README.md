## User Testing

## Challenges
One challenge that we faced was dealing with how to have users
delete tasks. Per the lab requirements, we made a button to
delete all completed tasks, but realized that was an unwieldy 
way of deleting single items. So we decided to add a delete button 
for each individual task and placed it next to the edit button. 
Additionally, we wanted to prevent users from accidentally
delete an item by having a pop-up confirmation for both the 
individual task delete button and the "delete all completed 
task" button. However, a pop-up would have required javascript, 
so we decided to leave that feature for a future re-implementation 
of this lab.
